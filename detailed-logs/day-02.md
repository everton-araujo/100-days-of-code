I finished the section 5 from the 
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery" target="_blank">course</a>
, which means that the HTML part is complete.
<br/>
And took the HTML 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp" target="_blank">quiz</a> from 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and make 87% of it (35/40).
<br/>
And I did 40 out of 90 of those HTML [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/html/exercise.asp).
</br>

Make a <a href="https://github.com/everton-araujo/rotative-banner" target="_blank">rotative banner</a> with pure js.
