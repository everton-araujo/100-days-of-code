I finished the section 5 from the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery), which means that the HTML part is complete.<br/>
And took the HTML [Quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp) from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and make 87% of it (35/40).<br/>
And I did 40 out of 90 of those HTML [exercises](https://www.w3schools.com/html/exercise.asp).</br>

Make a [rotative banner](https://github.com/everton-araujo/rotative-banner) with pure js.
