I finished the section 6 and 7 from the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery).<br>
And complete that [css selector game](https://flukeout.github.io/)<br>
And took the CSS [quiz](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_quiz.asp) from [w3schools]("https://www.w3schools.com/") and make 84%  of it (21/25)

## Some CSS anotations

\*<br>
This can select all elements

element1 > element2<br>
Means that you only apply the style for the child of the element1 (that is element2), if i want to reach the element3 will not work<br>
```
<element1>
    <element2>
        <element3></element3>
    </element2>
</element1>
```

:only-child
Takes any element that is the only element inside of another

:nth-of-type(odd or even)

element1 + element2<br>
Means that you get the exactly after element

element1 ~ element2<br>
Means that you get the all after elements

element:hover<br>
Means that will only apply the style when the mouse is over that element

!important
overwrite everything that comes later in the cascade, this is the styling that will be used
