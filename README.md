# 100 Days of Code (April 23, 2020 - August 01, 2020)

*This is a record of my 100 Days of Code Challenge.*

The rules are that i have to create some kind of code each day during the challenge. That include courses, small projects, contribute to open source, translate documentation, basically anything related to developement is valid.
