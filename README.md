# 100 Days of Code (April 23, 2020 - August 01, 2020)

*This is a record of my 100 Days of Code Challenge.*

The rules are that i have to create some kind of code each day during the challenge. That include courses, small projects, contribute to open source, translate documentation, basically anything related to developement is valid.

Those are my projects and logs for the challenge:
